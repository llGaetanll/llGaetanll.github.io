        The accents situation on Windows. For the longest time, windows has used alt codes to allow people to input special characters,

        their motorized wheelchairs using facial expressions.`,

        however it quickly evolved into something much more meaningful for all of us. We have created a prototype and pushed forward 
        the idea that motorized wheelchairs could in fact be controlled using only expressions of the face.`,
        `---`,
        `h3[The Prototype]`,
        `We first started by researching if the technology was possible. In our research, we found a Neural Net built by Google that plays 
        Pac Man with a webcam. The network learns to track the head of the user and assigns a direction to pacman based on which direction you 
        are looking in, and is ready to operate in seconds of training. We looked more into this Network and 
        eventually modified and repurposed it to build out first prototype of Mobius ML.`,
        `The problem with the original Network built by google is that it was built in with four directions, up down left and right, 
        However it does not take into consideration that the user may not always want to be moving at all times. This is where the modification 
        came in and we had to add one more potential output to our Neural Net.`,
        `We realized that this network was not limited to movements of your head but instead can be trained on any image 
        whatsoever. More testing showed that the network performed better unnder certain conditions that others so we spent some time 
        making sure that those conditions could be met as often as possible. This includes things like a simple backdrop, behind the user's face, 
        and lighting that doesn't wash out the lens of the camera.`,

        We do this because, when the user searches the database, we don't want to look through images and run these classification algorithms everytime, but instead through text and see what best matches 
        the user's query.`,
