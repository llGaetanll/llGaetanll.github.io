# `llgaetanll.github.io`

I use GitHub pages to host static files.

Currently, I'm using it to host two Machine Learning projects: [WikiSimilarity](https://github.com/llGaetanll/WikiSimilarity) and [PokemonClassification](https://github.com/llGaetanll/PokemonClassification), and my `rice.sh` script which you can learn more about at [`llgaetanll/autorice`](https://github.com/llGaetanll/autorice).
